## Note-It:

A React application that enables you to create your notes and organize them under separate titles which appear in the sidebar. This will help you to organise your thoughts, your to-do lists, daily appointments, random ideas, etc in an effective manner. This is version 1.0 and very basic with many more features to be added in the future.

## Different features of the website

* On loading, it displays the layout with current timing as per time-zone.
* You can give title to project, add notes and delete any of them.
* On pressing save, this project gets added to the list on the sidebar and all the notes get saved.
* If we make any changes to the saved note, then we need to again press "save" button to save those changes.
* We can create a new Project by pressing "Add New" button on the sidebar. This creates a new blank project to begin our work. 

## What will you learn

You will learn about following concepts:
* Creating a basic React application with dependencies of React and React-DOM
* Breaking the website into various re-usable components and creating them as jsx files
* Basic concepts like 
   * Inline styling for React elements
   * Import, Export and modules
   * React Props
   * Mapping and loops
   * Filter, Reduce and Find
   * Arrow functions
   * Hooks like useState and useEffect


## Features that will be soon added

Many features will be added to this project in the coming days-> 
* launching on firebase
* handle click on project list item -> get index and project item and setProject to matching index
* handle background
* handle Footer
* handle scrolling of Sidebar
* handle deleting projects 
* work on drag and set position of sticky notes
* make project list to toggle and increase the workspace

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
